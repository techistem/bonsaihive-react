# bonsaiHive (REACT UI)

[bonsaiHive](heroku site adresini yaz) is a dedicated community platform connecting bonsai enthusiasts across West Sussex.

Unlike general gardening forums or broad social networks, Bonsai Hive is specifically designed for the art and passion of bonsai — offering a focused, vibrant space where knowledge, creativity, and local connection thrive.

Bonsai lovers are encouraged to:

- Share photos of their bonsai trees,

- Exchange care tips and cultivation techniques,

- Discover and explore different bonsai styles,

- Follow and interact with fellow bonsai artists,

- Join local meetups and community events,

- Build a supportive and engaged bonsai network.

Only registered users can access the platform’s content — including posts, photos, tips, and profiles. Signing up unlocks full access to these community features.

The goal of this React-based user interface is to deliver an engaging, intuitive front-end experience that enables users to create, read, update, and delete bonsai-related content by interacting seamlessly with the [back-end API](heroku/admin yaz). This ensures a dynamic and user-friendly platform for growing both bonsai knowledge and community connections.

Whether you're just starting out or are a seasoned bonsai grower, bonsaiHive is the ideal place to grow your trees — and your network.
